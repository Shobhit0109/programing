//[6/28/2022, 2:16:06 AM] For C source files, IntelliSenseMode was changed from "linux-gcc-x64" to "linux-clang-x64" based on compiler args and querying compilerPath: "/usr/bin/clang"
//[6/28/2022, 2:16:06 AM] IntelliSenseMode was changed because it didn't match the detected compiler.  Consider setting "compilerPath" instead.  Set "compilerPath" to "" to disable detection of system includes and defines.
